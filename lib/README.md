# Name the Library

For now, the name of library is CustomElement, but you need to change the name of the library to something like UICustom, FlexyUI, or FlexyUIComponent and so on...

# Structure of lib source

- CustomElement.ts - this one is the main entry point for exporting anything that is related to the library!
